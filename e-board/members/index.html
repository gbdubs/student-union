		It is an honor to be your President. I am lucky enough to have found scholarship, prestige, dedication, and love of teaching and learning in the African and African American Studies Department, which is also my major.  The Student Union does not consume, but rather enrich my time at Brandeis. But when I am not dedicating myself to improving it, you can find me engaging in intellectual conversations about race and education for example, and ways in which we must be cognizant and critical about our individual privileges when navigating those spaces. You might also find me singing at a coffeehouse from time to time. I got involved in the Union when I saw that there was a real, productive opportunity to improve this university as one of its students. The goals I have do not take a semester, or even a year to achieve, nor will we see the results in that time. But one goal I have is to begin uniting the student body when there are so many reasons in our society to be divided. That unification starts with trust: the trust in your leaders to advocate, represent, and allocate, with the good of our community at the forefront of our agendas. That trust starts with transparency.  A new Student Union website that keeps regular updates of the achievements and setbacks of the Union, and a info graphic for students to understand the Union’s budget are just a few first steps. Your Senior Representative to the Board of Trustees, Grady Ward ‘16 is working tirelessly on the former, and I am working tirelessly on the latter. But the entire Union is working on these goals. However we cannot create sustained change on our own. The Student Union will continue to need your help. Be flexible, be demanding, be forgiving, but most importantly be ready to act. Improving this university is going to take time, but we need all hands on deck now. Let’s get to work!

		It is an honor and a pleasure to serve as this Student Unions Chief of Staff.  As a sophomore at Brandeis University, I double major in Politics and International Global Studies, and double minor in Hispanic Studies and African & African American Studies (however at the rate that I continue to take AAAS classes, I will more than likely qualify for a major). While my studies keep my mind enriched with rigor, my interests and dedication to the Brandeis community outside of my academics is what keeps my spirit high. Whether I’m on duty in East Quad as CA, in the library working on computers at LTS, or lending my mind, body and time to social causes across campus – I can always be found working on ways to make Brandeis a more inclusive and welcoming community. As the Unions Chief of Staff, my goals for my term include, but are most certainly not limited to: ensuring transparency by using students UNET and Gmail accounts – particularly utilizing google calendar as a way of seeing the various meetings and events that Union members partake in; bringing major issues within the Brandeis community to the attention of both the executive board, and the Administration; and making myself wholly available and accessible to all of the Brandeis community. I look forward to working with the Union and the community at large! Go Judges!

		I am a Politics major in the Class of 2017 at Brandeis. In addition to my work with the Student Union, I am proudly involved in the Brandeis University Jazz Ensemble. I have been involved in the Union since the fall of 2014. I initially decided to get involved with the Union on the recommendation of a friend, and I have decided to remain active because I feel like I have been effective voice for students. This year, I am eager to continue serving the community by working to review Union procedures and look for ways to give the Brandeis community greater access to the Union. I also hope to look for ways to improve some of the more specific functions of the Union, namely the way clubs are formed and supported by the Union.

I am also a member of the co-ed a cappella group, Starving Artists and I am a member of the greek organization, Sigma Delta Tau.  I got involved in the student union because I was offered a position to be an assistant treasurer and thought the experience would be beneficial to my field of study.  Once involved, I saw what a great organization the Student Union was.  One day, the treasurer, at the time, and I got to talking about what he enjoyed so much about the position; he felt he was giving a lot back to Brandeis by helping out with the organization of club funding.  He also said it was a great way to get involved on campus and to meet many important faculty members.  I thought it sounded like a great opportunity, so I decided to run.  My goal for this semester is to keep the treasury running smoothly.  I am very excited to get back to campus in the fall and get the semester going!

		I love bringing people together, and the Student Union is the perfect forum for that at Brandeis.  Far too often, I see students, faculty, alumni and trustees wary of one another, viewing each other with suspicion or mistrust.  Over the last several years, the relationships that hold these groups together has rusted, breaking down communication, and allowing us to forget that we all play for the same team.  I think Brandeis needs to be united to move forward, and I see my job as a role to bring all groups of the university closer to one another through communication.  There is nothing that isn't possible when you are ready and able to talk to the right people about it. As a student advocate, my role is to address the real concerns of students (financial aid, campus safety, educational outcomes) on a long term basis. As someone with good connections within the administration and trustees, my job is a communicator, trying to explain why our school makes the choices that it does, and focusing on how we as students can influence those decisions.  `

I serve as the Treasurer of Brandeis Democrats and am a member of the university’s sketch comedy troupe, Boris’ Kitchen. I ran for a position with the Student Union after students noticed that Brandeis administration did not clearly communicate its intentions for certain spaces on campus, and as such I will work to increase transparency between the administration and the student body. In this first semester, I also plan to investigate Brandeis’s laundry services provider and explore possible alternatives.

		Hi! I am a Biology major on the Pre-Medical School track from Queens, New York. In addition to my role on the Student Union I work for the Campus Center Team, I am the event coordinator for Brandeis Black Student Organization, a JFEW Scholar, the technology chair for Sigma Delta Tau and I am a part of several clubs on campus. Some of those clubs are Women’s Brandeis Football Club, Global Medical Brigades, Photography Club, and I often volunteer for Admissions programs. I joined the Student Union to broaden the student body’s knowledge of who is the Student Union and what they do. I felt as a sophomore that I did not very much about what this amazing group of people do for the student body and wanted to change that.
