Hi! I'm Sarah. I'm a first year, and am from New York City! I'm on the Pre-Med track and plan to major in Biology and International and Global Studies with minors in Gender Studies and Anthropology. I work with the Department of Community Service at the Community Service Partner Liaison, and am extremely passionate about GirlUp: a campaign of the UN Foundation that empowers women around the world. I am ecstatic to have been picked as the Media Manager for the Student Union, and can't wait to see where the position goes! For all media related inquiries, please do not hesitate to reach out to me!
