Hi! I'm a first year, and am from New York City! I am double majoring in Computer Science and International and Global Studies with a double minor in Economics and Gender Studies. When I am not amidst meetings for the South Asian Student Association, hosting and coordinating GirlUp meetings, furthering Alpha Pi Phi's outreach, or organizing events for the Department of Community Service, I spend my time on campus involved in other causes I am passionate about! I am ecstatic to have been picked as the Media Manager for the Student Union, and am honored to be able to channel my Brandeis pride into representing the Student Union on its social media forefront! For all things media (or otherwise), please do not hesitate to reach out to me.
