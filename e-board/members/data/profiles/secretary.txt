Originally from Shanghai, China, I am currently a senior at Brandeis double majoring Economics and Business.. Beside the student union, I also work as a BUGS tutor. My goal for joining the Student Union is to develop a comprehensive understanding of Student Union and serve to improve studentsâ€™ experience at Brandeis. Through collaboration with my fellow student union members I wish to serve the student body to the best of its interests. My goal for the new academic year is to improve student engagement and establish a more inclusive environment at Brandeis University.
