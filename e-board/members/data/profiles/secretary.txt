Originally from Shanghai, China, I am currently a senior at Brandeis double
majoring Economics and Business. Besides the Student Union, I also work as a BUGS tutor. My goal is to develop a comprehensive
understanding of Student Union and I serve to improve the student experience at Brandeis. I would also like to improve student engagement and establish a more inclusive environment at Brandeis University. Through collaboration with my fellow Student Union members, I wish to
serve the student body to the best of its interests.
