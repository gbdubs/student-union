Hi! I am a Biology major on the Pre-Medical School track from Queens, New York. In addition to my role on the Student Union I work for the Campus Center Team, I am the event coordinator for Brandeis Black Student Organization, a JFEW Scholar, the technology chair for Sigma Delta Tau and I am a part of several clubs on campus. Some of those clubs are Women’s Brandeis Football Club, Global Medical Brigades, Photography Club, and I often volunteer for Admissions programs. I joined the Student Union to broaden the student body’s knowledge of who is the Student Union and what they do. I felt as a sophomore that I did not very much about what this amazing group of people do for the student body and wanted to change that.
