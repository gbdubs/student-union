It is an honor and a pleasure to serve as this Student Unions Chief of Staff.  As a sophomore at Brandeis University, I double major in Politics and International Global Studies, and double minor in Hispanic Studies and African & African American Studies (however at the rate that I continue to take AAAS classes, I will more than likely qualify for a major). While my studies keep my mind enriched with rigor, my interests and dedication to the Brandeis community outside of my academics is what keeps my spirit high. Whether I’m on duty in East Quad as CA, in the library working on computers at LTS, or lending my mind, body and time to social causes across campus – I can always be found working on ways to make Brandeis a more inclusive and welcoming community. As the Unions Chief of Staff, my goals for my term include, but are most certainly not limited to: ensuring transparency by using students UNET and Gmail accounts – particularly utilizing google calendar as a way of seeing the various meetings and events that Union members partake in; bringing major issues within the Brandeis community to the attention of both the executive board, and the Administration; and making myself wholly available and accessible to all of the Brandeis community. I look forward to working with the Union and the community at large! Go Judges!
