I pride myself on being up to date. As the Director of Communication it is my duty to keep the campus up to date on all things that are intimately connected and formally connected to them. As a Afro and African American Studies and Sociology double major I concentrate on the ways in which people effectively communicate across diverse backgrounds and cultures. I use this data to produce innovative ways and avenues to communicate with diverse groups of people such as the Brandeis community. I am excited to be apart of the Student Union for my senior year and I am looking forward to aiding this board in success in the upcoming year.
