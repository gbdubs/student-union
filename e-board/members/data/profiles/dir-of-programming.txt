Adriana Gleaton is a current junior studying Psychology and African and Afro-American Studies with a minor in Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. She has experience in organizing, event planning, and group development with both small and large organizations. Outside of the Student Union Adriana is a member of Brandeis Climate Justice and The Brandeis Storytelling Brigade. Adriana got involved with the Student Union as the Director of Programming to minimize the gap between faculty and students at Brandeis, by creating enjoyable events that are conducive to building a more transparent atmosphere between the students and faculty. This semester Adriana has set quite a few goals for herself, but one that she is most eager to achieve is to have one event at the end of the semester, where the faculty and students will dance together (stay tuned for that).
