I am a junior student majoring in history and economics and minoring in legal studies and business.  On campus, I am the Undergraduate Department Representative for Economic Department. I am also active member on campus. I was the Deis Day coordinator in the Student Union and the event coordinator in Brandeis Chinese Cultural Connection. I join the Student Union as an Associate Justice of the Student Union Judiciary since I want to help students to settle the disputes between different clubs. For the first semester, I hope I can help to let students know what are the responsibilities of student union judiciary and encourage them to report their disputes to judiciary.
