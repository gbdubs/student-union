Associate Justice

At Brandeis University, I am a Biochemistry and Biology double major with minors in chemistry and legal studies. While I am new to the Student Union this year as an Associate Justice to the Union Judiciary, I have been involved in Brandeis in many ways, such as becoming a Senior Help Desk Consultant at the LTS Computer Help Desk, working as a chatter in the Admissions Office, and becoming a new member of BEMCo. Given my interest in legal studies, I decided to get involved with the Union Judiciary so that I could apply my interest in a way that will have an impact on the student community of Brandeis. As a member of the Union Judiciary, I hope to increase the transparency that this branch of the Student government has with the community at large, as well as clarify the services we provide at Brandeis and the proper channels to obtaining them.
