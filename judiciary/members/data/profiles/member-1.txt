My name is Stephanie Sjoblom, I'm a junior double majoring in Business and Economics with a minor in Computer Science! I'm also the student coordinator at Media Technology Services, the group responsible for maintaining all of Brandeisâ€™ technology across campus. We also serve as tech support for faculty members and as tech setup for all events. In addition to my work, I also spend a lot of time in the theatre working backstage with tech. I'm very excited to join the Student Union as one of the Associate Justices of the Judiciary together with three of my fellow Justices! With the growing number of clubs available to the student body, it becomes increasingly crucial to maintain the system in place to deal with conflicts and problems as they arise. I was honored to be elected into the Student Union, and it was my intent to join the Union and strengthen the process put in place to deal with these situations. As an Associate Justice, I hope to work with my peers to create a better way for students to connect with us as Justices and educate the student body that we are available as a resource and as a mediating body.
