Brian Dorfman is a senior at Brandeis University, and the Chief Justice of the Student Union Judiciary.  He is a Psychology and Theatre Arts Major.  Apart from his duties as Chief Justice, he also participates in Brandeis University Mock Trial Association and even finds time to direct and act in the Brandeis Theatre community.  In Spring 2016, you can find his senior thesis production of W;t in the Brandeis Theatre Arts Department.  He got involved in the Union to make sure that there was a consistent standard that every member of the Brandeis community was held to: the Student Union Constitution.  By the end of Fall 2015, he hopes that every student knows how to access that Constitution so that they can know their rights and responsibilities.
