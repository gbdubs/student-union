		Brian Dorfman is a senior at Brandeis University, and the Chief Justice of the Student Union Judiciary.  He is a Psychology and Theatre Arts Major.  Apart from his duties as Chief Justice, he also participates in Brandeis University Mock Trial Association and even finds time to direct and act in the Brandeis Theatre community.  In Spring 2016, you can find his senior thesis production of W;t in the Brandeis Theatre Arts Department.  He got involved in the Union to make sure that there was a consistent standard that every member of the Brandeis community was held to: the Student Union Constitution.  By the end of Fall 2015, he hopes that every student knows how to access that Constitution so that they can know their rights and responsibilities.

		My name is Stephanie Sjoblom, I'm a junior double majoring in Business and Economics with a minor in Computer Science! I'm also the student coordinator at Media Technology Services, the group responsible for maintaining all of Brandeis’ technology across campus. We also serve as tech support for faculty members and as tech setup for all events. In addition to my work, I also spend a lot of time in the theatre working backstage with tech. I'm very excited to join the Student Union as one of the Associate Justices of the Judiciary together with three of my fellow Justices! With the growing number of clubs available to the student body, it becomes increasingly crucial to maintain the system in place to deal with conflicts and problems as they arise. I was honored to be elected into the Student Union, and it was my intent to join the Union and strengthen the process put in place to deal with these situations. As an Associate Justice, I hope to work with my peers to create a better way for students to connect with us as Justices and educate the student body that we are available as a resource and as a mediating body.

		At Brandeis University, I am a Biochemistry and Biology double major with minors in chemistry and legal studies. While I am new to the Student Union this year as an Associate Justice to the Union Judiciary, I have been involved in Brandeis in many ways, such as becoming a Senior Help Desk Consultant at the LTS Computer Help Desk, working as a chatter in the Admissions Office, and becoming a new member of BEMCo. Given my interest in legal studies, I decided to get involved with the Union Judiciary so that I could apply my interest in a way that will have an impact on the student community of Brandeis. As a member of the Union Judiciary, I hope to increase the transparency that this branch of the Student government has with the community at large, as well as clarify the services we provide at Brandeis and the proper channels to obtaining them.

		I am a junior student majoring in history and economics and minoring in legal studies and business.  On campus, I am the Undergraduate Department Representative for Economic Department. I am also active member on campus. I was the Deis Day coordinator in the Student Union and the event coordinator in Brandeis Chinese Cultural Connection. I join the Student Union as an Associate Justice of the Student Union Judiciary since I want to help students to settle the disputes between different clubs. For the first semester, I hope I can help to let students know what are the responsibilities of student union judiciary and encourage them to report their disputes to judiciary.
