Aboard Changes Imminent, Announced at Press Conference
President Nyah Macklin emailed the student body on Wednesday to announce a press conference about the challenges that the A-Board has faced this year, and to discuss the potential for structural changes to prevent similar mistakes and inconveniences in the future.  Macklin's discerussion at the press conference has now been proposed as a constitutional ammendment that would restructure A-Board to an eleven member body much more like the Senate.  More details on the proposal can be found in the campus wide email describing the Changes.
