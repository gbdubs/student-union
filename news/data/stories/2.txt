Reps to the Board of Trustees Release Survey Results
Emily Conrad '17 and Grady Ward '16 Announced the survey results in an email to the student body, detailing the findings of their surveys and interviews with undergraduates, faculty, administrators and trustees.  The report focused on tangible changes that the University could make to better support its students and improve the optics of its financial aid policies, with the end goal of supporting the emotional and financial wellbeing of students as best as possible.  The 36-page report was heavily discussed in the campus papers, and will serve as a jumping off point from which the Board of Trustees will thoroughly examine financial policy at the beginning of the next year.
