Off Campus Card Access Changes
Spearheaded by Sam Krystal ‘17, Off Campus Senator
Supported by the Senate
It was recently noted that students who lived off-campus would not be granted access to on-campus housing this semester. This decision was made in an effort to further continue the University’s strides to creating a more secure and safe campus. Many students who lived in on-campus housing made complaints that students who did not belong to their halls, dorms, or even the on-campus community were occupying in on-campus housing spaces in inappropriate ways. This was met with frustration from the off-campus community. We are working with the Department of Community Living and a number of other administrators to see how we can collaborate to come to a solution that does not negatively affect and even alienate such a large portion of Brandeis’ community.
