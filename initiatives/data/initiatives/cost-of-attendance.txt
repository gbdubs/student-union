The price of attending Brandeis is significantly higher than is acceptable. How has this been impacting how students are able to afford this university? We are working with Trustees, Administration and alumni to try to make sure that when we increase the cost of attendance, we increase financial aid by a proportional amount. This is why we have implemented the Financial Awareness Survey which first was sent out to student’s Brandeis emails on September 22nd. Since then we have compiled the results from that survey and the next step is to present that information both to the Board of Trustees and to the Brandeis Community the week of October 25th.
