Know Your Rights Campaign
Spearheaded by Nyah Macklin ‘16, President 
E-Board Initiative, assisted by Justin Carlisle
All too often I have found that we as young adults, while operating within this or any institution, fail to understand our rights as students. Many students, when becoming entangled with complicated issues that face our society, are unaware of the rights they have, and so can not draw upon that knowledge, and act upon that knowledge. This is a larger problem in our society. This campaign stems from seeing people of color gunned down and frequently killed in the streets by law enforcement. One of the problems with this is that we (I myself a person of color) do not know our rights. So we as the Student Union will be teaching our colleagues their rights with the hope that this extensive knowledge of the Rights and Responsibilities Handbook on Brandeis’ campus can transfer to an increased awareness of the lack of knowledge surrounding civil and human rights in our larger society. Look out for the first installment this November!
