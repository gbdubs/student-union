	<h5 class="txt-brandeis-blue-0">Team: All of E-Board, Led by Nyah Macklin '16</h5>
	<p>The price of attending Brandeis is significantly higher than is acceptable. How has this been impacting how students are able to afford this university? We are working with Trustees, Administration and alumni to try to make sure that when we increase the cost of attendance, we increase financial aid by a proportional amount. This is why we have implemented the Financial Awareness Survey which first was sent out to student’s Brandeis emails on September 22nd. Since then we have compiled the results from that survey and the next step is to present that information both to the Board of Trustees and to the Brandeis Community the week of October 25th. </p>

	<h5 class="txt-brandeis-blue-0">Leaders: Spearheaded by Nyah Macklin ‘16, President </h5>
	<h5 class="txt-brandeis-blue-0">Team: E-Board Initiative, assisted by Justin Carlisle</h5>
	<p>All too often I have found that we as young adults, while operating within this or any institution, fail to understand our rights as students. Many students, when becoming entangled with complicated issues that face our society, are unaware of the rights they have, and so can not draw upon that knowledge, and act upon that knowledge. This is a larger problem in our society. This campaign stems from seeing people of color gunned down and frequently killed in the streets by law enforcement. One of the problems with this is that we (I myself a person of color) do not know our rights. So we as the Student Union will be teaching our colleagues their rights with the hope that this extensive knowledge of the Rights and Responsibilities Handbook on Brandeis’ campus can transfer to an increased awareness of the lack of knowledge surrounding civil and human rights in our larger society. Look out for the first installment this November!</p>

	<h3 class="bg-brandeis-blue-1 txt-brandeis-white">Sustainability: Meatless Mondays in Sherman Dining Hall</h3>
	<h5 class="txt-brandeis-blue-0">Leaders: Spearheaded by Matt Smetana ‘17, Senator to the Class of 2017</h5>
	<h5 class="txt-brandeis-blue-0">Team: Supported by the Senate</h5>
	<p>Meatless Monday’s was an idea we have been wanting to implement for years. It is an event where the participating dining facility, chooses not to serve meat for one day out of the week.   We chose to have this event because we wanted to reduce our meat consumption just for one night.This event about showing people that they can have a direct affect on the planet where they’d least expect it…in their diets.  Background: Livestock produce tons of greenhouse gasses, particularly in the form of methane and carbon dioxide. The production of meat is also the cause of 80% of Amazonian deforestation, and extreme runoff heading into the Gulf of Mexico.The factory farming industry is also known for the overuse of antibiotics on their animals, causing superbugs that infect tens of thousands of humans; with no antibiotics that can work, almost all the people who receive them die. Meat is also exceedingly high in saturated fats (red meat being the worst) that cause heart disease and numerous cancers. Americans are found to eat much more than the recommended amounts, so by taking a couple meals out of your week you can make an impact on not only your well-being but also on the planet.   Results: The feedback has been extremely positive. We surveyed about 2/3 of people that dined at Sherman Dining Hall on 10/5 (our first Meatless Monday) (about 300 people). The results have shown that the majority of people were very satisfied with the food and 86% of people would like to see more Meatless Mondays in the future. Being that we are a social justice institution, people understand that environmental and animal rights issues are important and we had numerous vegetarians and vegans voicing their appreciation for having numerous options for the first time since coming to Brandeis. But the majority of people are not vegetarian/vegan yet they enjoyed it as well! </p>

	<h3 class="bg-brandeis-blue-1 txt-brandeis-white">Off Campus Card Access Changes</h3>
	<h5 class="txt-brandeis-blue-0">Leaders: Spearheaded by Sam Krystal ‘17, Off Campus Senator</h5>
	<h5 class="txt-brandeis-blue-0">Team: Supported by the Senate</h5>
	<p>It was recently noted that students who lived off-campus would not be granted access to on-campus housing this semester. This decision was made in an effort to further continue the University’s strides to creating a more secure and safe campus. Many students who lived in on-campus housing made complaints that students who did not belong to their halls, dorms, or even the on-campus community were occupying in on-campus housing spaces in inappropriate ways. This was met with frustration from the off-campus community. We are working with the Department of Community Living and a number of other administrators to see how we can collaborate to come to a solution that does not negatively affect and even alienate such a large portion of Brandeis’ community. </p>
