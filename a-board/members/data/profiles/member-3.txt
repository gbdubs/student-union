My name is Arlenys Reyes and it has been an honor to be a part of the allocations board. As a first year student I am exploring different interests and this is one that is worth noting. I am also part of the E-board of the Catholic Student Organization in addition to my allocations board position, which has allowed me to see the two sides funding. I enjoy playing volleyball, doing yoga and just spending quality time with family and friends. Different people would describe me as a hardworking and passionate individual who does not allow obstacles to stop me in my tracks. I hope to travel the world someday and learn about different cultures as I develop relationships with people who are not like me. My interest also lies in business and economics and I hope to combine that with my passion to travel. I am determined to accomplish this and I know it is possible with the help of those who have encouraged me in the past and continue to do so today. I am a loving aunt from New York City who never leaves my house without earrings and loves feel the rhythm of bachata.
