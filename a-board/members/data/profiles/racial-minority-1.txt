Hi, my name is Jiabei Wang, and I am a sophomore. I am on the racial minority seat of Allocation Board in student union. As an international student from China, I deeply understand the opinions and demands of those who have the same background as me. I am working to help allocate school funds to clubs representing students of a racial minority in a just and transparent way. I am open to hearing opinions from all students and I will do my best to fulfill your demands to create a more open and diverse campus.
