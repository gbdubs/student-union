Racial Minority A-Board Member

union@brandeis.edu
Hello, my name is Xiaoran Wang. I am currently a sophomore majoring in Economics and Business and I am also a member of Brandeis Equestrian team. I join the union because I am curious about how clubs function and how financial system works in college. I also want to represent the voices of international students and help to bring more diversity into the student union. As an A-board member, I will allocate activity fees fairly to each club, cooperate with my team and try my best to work on the transparency of finance on campus. Office Hours: Thursday: 12:00-1:30pm; 3:30-5:00pm.
