Intended Majors: IGS, Politics;  Intended Minors: Business, Legal Studies.  I'm also a 'Deis Impacter and an event coordinator of BC3 (Brandeis Chinese Cultural Connection). I got involved in the union because my previous experiences as president of student union during high school and middle school taught me how to genuinely serve and help students. I enjoy teamwork and friendly working environment. I believe I would learn more in Brandeis Student Union. As the Racial Minority A-board member, I will dedicate to allocate Activities Fee to serve the best interests of students! I'm always here for help.
