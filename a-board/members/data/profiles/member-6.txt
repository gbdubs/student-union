Hello! My name is Emma Russell, and I am currently a freshman member on the Allocations Board and the Non-Senate Chair of the Services and Outreach Committee of the student union. I plan to major in Biology on a pre-med track and minor in South Asian Studies. After getting involved in the student union as Non-Senate Chair for the Services and Outreach Committee, I fell in love with the work the student union does throughout campus, whether it be putting on huge events like Midnight Buffet or simply listening to students’ concerns. As a part of  A-Board, I can further help the student body by allocating funds in its best interest and staying aware through more direct contact with clubs. I can’t wait to keep working towards a better A-Board and student union on campus!
