Hello! My name is Alex and I am a junior majoring in Neuroscience, Biological Physics, and Biochemistry. In addition to being on the Allocations Board, I am a UDR for the Neuroscience program and an active participant in campus spiritual life. After class I like to either play basketball with friends or head down to Slosberg to practice piano. I joined the union to support Brandeis’ core values of academic excellence and social justice, and my mission as a union member is to help clubs and organizations that support Brandeis’ mission in these areas. My goal is for the Student Union support the academic interests of Brandeis students to the fullest possible extent. My office hours are Sundays from 12-3pm.
