I’m Millie Wu, currently a sophomore member in the Allocation Board of Student Union. Haven’t decided my major completely, but I had set my mind on the Economics/Business route. I joined the Union since my freshman year, out of pure curiosity of a different experience. Entering thinking how much I would impact the student body, and ending the year to realize how much the union had shaped me. Being a part of the union is not only about seeing changes in others, but as well as myself. I felt as I was put in a spot where I constantly had to be thinking critically, confronting my weakness, and thriving to be my best. I want to immerse myself in a challenging environment, and that’s why here I am back in the union once again. Outside of the union, I have been involved in many treasury positions for clubs, such as BAASA, BTMC, and BSLE. Seeing ahead, I would like to be a diligence member of the A-board attending to club finance matters continuously. If chances allow, I would like to open discussion with the Board of Trustees about the transparency of finance within campus.
