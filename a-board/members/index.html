I am also a member of the co-ed a cappella group, Starving Artists and I am a member of the greek organization, Sigma Delta Tau.  I got involved in the student union because I was offered a position to be an assistant treasurer and thought the experience would be beneficial to my field of study.  Once involved, I saw what a great organization the Student Union was.  One day, the treasurer, at the time, and I got to talking about what he enjoyed so much about the position; he felt he was giving a lot back to Brandeis by helping out with the organization of club funding.  He also said it was a great way to get involved on campus and to meet many important faculty members.  I thought it sounded like a great opportunity, so I decided to run.  My goal for this semester is to keep the treasury running smoothly.  I am very excited to get back to campus in the fall and get the semester going!

		Hello! My name is Emma Russell, and I am currently a freshman member on the Allocations Board and the Non-Senate Chair of the Services and Outreach Committee of the student union. I plan to major in Biology on a pre-med track and minor in South Asian Studies. After getting involved in the student union as Non-Senate Chair for the Services and Outreach Committee, I fell in love with the work the student union does throughout campus, whether it be putting on huge events like Midnight Buffet or simply listening to students’ concerns. As a part of  A-Board, I can further help the student body by allocating funds in its best interest and staying aware through more direct contact with clubs. I can’t wait to keep working towards a better A-Board and student union on campus!
