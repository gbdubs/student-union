		I am a Politics major in the Class of 2017 at Brandeis. In addition to my work with the Student Union, I am proudly involved in the Brandeis University Jazz Ensemble. I have been involved in the Union since the fall of 2014. I initially decided to get involved with the Union on the recommendation of a friend, and I have decided to remain active because I feel like I have been effective voice for students. This year, I am eager to continue serving the community by working to review Union procedures and look for ways to give the Brandeis community greater access to the Union. I also hope to look for ways to improve some of the more specific functions of the Union, namely the way clubs are formed and supported by the Union.

		Shalom, my fellow Brandeisans! My name is Lorenzo Finamore and I am incredibly excited to represent you next year as one of your senators at large. When I first became involved with the student union last year it was because I believed that with a little bit of effort North Quad (the quad I represented at the time) could be vastly improved. Now that I have a better perspective on how change can be achieved, I would like to make progress on several long term issues before the first semester ends, including improving the accessibility (transportation wise) and variety of cross registering for classes at other universities to make it a more realistic option for students. Outside of the student Union I enjoy playing intramural sports and plan to triple major in economics, politics and IGS. I’m always interested in talking about how we can improve Brandies so if you ever have a suggestion or a criticism please don’t be afraid to approach me in person or send me an email!

Besides being a senator in the Union with great honor, I’m the President of Brandeis Traditional Music Club, a member of Blood Drive and Equestrian club, and worked in the Deis Day Committee. Since the day I entered Brandeis, with the help of my friends, student leaders and faculties, I gradually overcame all kinds of obstacles that I faced in this whole new world to me—this foreign college full of intelligent people in an unacquainted country. In the meantime, I also saw some problems existing in our school. Thus, I decided to join the Union to help solve these problems and repay the people who helped me with my service. I would like to work at the Social Justice Committee next semester, joining hands with the clubs and organizations, such as the Office of Prevention Services. We’ll hold activities that have an impact on campus and draw people’s attention on sexual/ethnic violence and inequality.

		Hi I’m Beth, I’m majoring in Biological Physics and minoring Economic. I am currently the Racial Minority Senator in the Student Union. Throughout my Brandeis career, I have been part of BASO (Brandeis African Student Organization), BBSO (Brandeis Black Student Association), and WOCA (Women of Color Alliance). I ran for a student union position to become an even more active advocate for the diverse student body on campus. I founded the facebook page Black Brandeis, to acknowledge and celebrate Black Presence, and #BlackExcellence in the Brandeis community. During my time at the student union, I would like to publish a yearly calendar to highlight important events from the various cultural groups that happen on campus. I would like my position as Racial Minority Senator to bring various cultural groups together through monthly meetings/checkins and through collaborative event planning. Currently, I am involved with planning the Brandeis Diversity Conference that will bring students from many backgrounds together to discuss important topics of race (ethnicity), class, and gender that affect our lived experiences. In addition, I am scheduling joint-events for Black History Month, National Hispanic Heritage Month, Asian-Pacific American Heritage Month this year to acknowledge, and celebrate the triumphs and achievements of many people of color both in and outside Brandeis.

As I am captivated by all things political and international, my long term goals include graduating from law school and finding work that keeps me in close contact with China, where I studied abroad in the Spring of 2015. When I’m not focused on my Senate duties, I can be found working events with SPS, raising support for Brandeis among alumni, and playing tennis. I first became involved in the Union as a Sophomore in order to give back to the community that has given me so much, and that same inspiration lead me to join the Union again for my final year at Brandeis. Some of the many goals I have for my tenure include further beautifying our campus, encouraging the administration to make more funds available for academic research in the Social Sciences, and continuing the work I participated in with the Senate Diversity Committee during my previous term. I look forward to a year that is full of excitement and growth for the Brandeis community as a whole as well as a fitting capstone for an incredibly formative time in my life.

Aside from being a Class of 2017 Senator I lead the Brandeis Sustainability Committee and strive to make our campus a more environmentally conscious place. I joined the student union to bridge the divide between students, the Student Union, and the administration. Most importantly, I am a voice for the Class of 2017 and am extremely open to discuss issues relevant to all members of my class or other persons. Over the past semester, the Sustainability Committee sent a proposal for a university-wide environmental literacy requirement to the Undergraduate Curriculum Committee and reviewed the Brandeis Sustainability Fund proposals. Over this semester, the committee will be creating a video series educating the Brandeis community on climate change and environmental degradation.

		My name is Nathan Greess and I am proud to be serving as Class of 2019 Senator on the Student Union Senate! I live and went to school in Massachusetts and on campus, I live in Shapiro Hall in Massell Quad. I am a prospective economics and politics major and I also have an interest in topics of history and women’s studies. Outside of my duties at the Union, I work with NARAL, a non-profit organization focused on women’s health policy, which has a campus chapter as well. I became involved in the Union with the hope and intent of providing strong representation to the Class of 2019 and supporting broader community development. Since being elected, I have attempted to immerse myself in the intricate ins and outs of the Union and University, hoping to identify the best ways to advocate and produce results for students and their ideas. Moreover, I view the Senate and Union as integral to Brandeis’ strong community as the students’ collective voice—what the Union lacks in unfettered power it can make up for in the power to advocate. This year, I intend to focus on making efficient our clubs and club funding as to better support causes about which Brandeis’ students are passionate. More broadly, I hope to foster a culture of communication between the Union and students so ideas, concerns, and questions reach the people who can best address them. I am greatly looking forward to working with my peers in the Union and throughout the community to get to work on the issues that matter to you!

		Hi, my name is Mitch Mankin. I'm a senior majoring in Economics and International and Global Studies, with a minor in Social Justice and Social Policy. In addition to the Student Union, I'm involved in the Brandeis International Journal, Brandeis Labor Coalition, Brandeis Jazz Ensemble, Brandeis Improv Collective, and Brandeis Academic Debate and Speech Society. I'm currently choosing among several initiatives to pursue this semester. Those initiatives are as follows: 1) Creating a guide that will walk students through the process of finding off-campus housing, including figures on average area rents and typical food expenditures, information on building effective relationships with landlords, and basics of searching for and evaluating homes. This guide would likely require a survey of current off-campus students and would take a significant investment of time. 2) Working with the Brandeis administration to create a petition process similar to that of petitions.whitehouse.gov, which would create a robust framework for democratic dialogue between the students and the administration on the issues closest to our hearts. 3) Restoring full ID card access to on-campus dorms and common spaces for off-campus students, after the Department of Community Living revoked it without notice last semester. I recognize that the obstacles to each of these initiatives may be considerable, and regardless of their progress I will continue to listen to and seek out the opinions of my constituents, in order to better represent their concerns in the Student Union and accomplish the smaller projects that are important to them. Don't hesitate to reach out with any questions, concerns, or ideas to mrocket@brandeis.edu

		I am majoring in Politics and have minors in Islamic/Middle Eastern Studies and Social Justice.  I am on the Quidditch team, co-host the late night radio show “Eli & Kenyon 3: Turtles in Time” and am co-president of the Brandeis Comic Book Club.  However, the club I am most proud of is Game Knight where I serve as Lord President for Life.  Game Knight meets on Friday nights in the Castle Commons and is a lot of fun.  You should come some time. I didn’t mean to run for Student Union.  Since sophomore year a group of my friends has been writing in my name as a joke for most elections and Mod voter turnout was low enough that we accidentally won.  I accepted the position to further the cause of Brandeis Fun Bucks.  Brandeis Fun Bucks is the campaign to change the name of the Brandeis dining “points” to “Brandeis Fun Bucks”.  Brandeis Fun Bucks are the dream of a better future that we all share.  Currently Game Knight is the club to actively endorse Brandeis Fun Bucks (with some support from the Turtles in Time DJs) but we hope to gain support throughout the year.  Furthering the cause of Brandeis Fun Bucks is my primary goal for this semester.  I look forward to representing the Mods and the Brandeis community.

Outside of the Student Union I am a Waltham Group Coordinator for Blood Drive, and a two time Orientation Leader. My inspiration for being apart of the Student Union is the enthusiasm and vision of the students here. Being surrounded by their amazing minds, I want to ensure their ideas are heard and acted upon. As a senator, I look forward to being the chairperson of the Campus Operations Working Group, and improving Facilities and DCL through initiatives that will benefit the student body.

Outside of student union she is an admissions ambassador and enjoys doing theater. Valarie got involved in the student union because she felt a strong need to give back to the Brandeis community that has given so much to her. As the Charles River/ 567 senator, her goal is to represent the needs and opinions of her fellow residents and work together to affect real change on the issues they find most important.

		Hi, I’m Callahan Cox. I’m a sophomore from South Carolina and am interested in studying International and Global Studies. I enjoy college (Go Gamecocks!) and national league football and also enjoy watching a leisurely golf tournament on a Sunday afternoon.  On campus I’m also involved with the fitness club Brandeis Firecrackers and I also recently joined the Mountain Club, and hope to become more involved with them.  I also hope to continue volunteering and donating with the Waltham Blood Drive on campus.  In addition to my club activities and classes, I also work at Facility Services on campus and hope to work with the Campus Operations Working Group committee to help with any on campus problems.  I got involved with Student Union in the hopes of being more aware of what is going on at Brandeis and how these changes will affect me and my fellow students and making these happenings known to others.  During my first semester as East Quad Senator I hope to be able to bring a game table or television remote to the shared lounge.

Outside of student union, I run for the Cross Country and Track & Field teams (skew!), grade for math classes, and often find myself perusing the c-store for upwards of 12 hours per day. I got involved in the union because I want to help shape our campus by bridging the gap between the voices of students and faculty/staff. By the end of the first semester, I hope to make alterations to the Brandeis' By-Laws (as part of the Means and Ends Committee) that help campus function smoother, and provide the best resources possible to Castle residents.

		Hi everyone! My name is Hannah Brown and I am the Senator for North Quad for the 2015-2016 school year. I am a first-year who is currently undeclared, but I hope to pursue a double-major in Business and International and Global Studies. I was born and raised in Longview, Texas where I participated actively in school and activities and learned how to take on a leadership role, and now I am excited to be up North. In addition to the Student Union, I am also a member of TAMID, The Odyssey at Brandeis, Krav Maga Club and more; plus, I love participating in community service. I like to stay busy, but, when I’m not working, I enjoy reading, writing, staying fit, and spending time with friends and family. I joined the Student Union in order to give to the people who have already given so much to me. I love people, I love to be productive and helpful, and I love Brandeis, so I am ready to work for the students here. My goals for the year include expanding Brandeisian pride, improving cleanliness and uptake of facilities, community bonding, and advancing the goals of my constituents; my first initiative will be to obtain community cleaning supplies for the dorms. I pride myself on being approachable, so do not be afraid to talk to me in-person or to contact me through social media or my email, hcbrown@brandeis.edu. I want to be there for you if you need advice, have ideas or critiques, or simply need someone to chat with. I want to hear from you, and I would love to meet you. I aim to make the college experience at Brandeis more comfortable and more enjoyable for the residents of North Quad and for all Brandeisians - I look forward to working for (and with) you!

		Hey everyone! I am majoring in International and Global Studies and considering adding a minor business. In addition to serving in the Student Union, I am in the Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity, and I am a sports section writer for The Justice. I hope to become more involved with WBRS, with the idea of having a radio show and broadcasting games for the Judges. I involved myself with the Student Union in order to enact tangible change for my peers and the Brandeis community. Brandeis’ student life flourishes because of the opportunities students are presented with, whether it is through clubs, organizations, residence life, or other means. I hope Student Union is a vehicle to better the overall student experience by helping students’ efforts and providing them with more opportunities.It is through providing opportunities which we see Brandeis’ best qualities—a tight-knit, inclusive community blended with a sense of resound individualism. As Massell Quad Senator, my first priority is representing the residents of Massell Quad and bettering life for all students and community members. I hope to improve Massell Quad by working to develop three-to-five significant improvements to facilities.
