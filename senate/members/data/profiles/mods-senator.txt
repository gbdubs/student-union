Mods Senator

Kenyon Fraser
kenyon@brandeis.edu
I am majoring in Politics and have minors in Islamic/Middle Eastern Studies and Social Justice.  I am on the Quidditch team, co-host the late night radio show “Eli & Kenyon 3: Turtles in Time” and am co-president of the Brandeis Comic Book Club.  However, the club I am most proud of is Game Knight where I serve as Lord President for Life.  Game Knight meets on Friday nights in the Castle Commons and is a lot of fun.  You should come some time. I didn’t mean to run for Student Union.  Since sophomore year a group of my friends has been writing in my name as a joke for most elections and Mod voter turnout was low enough that we accidentally won.  I accepted the position to further the cause of Brandeis Fun Bucks.  Brandeis Fun Bucks is the campaign to change the name of the Brandeis dining “points” to “Brandeis Fun Bucks”.  Brandeis Fun Bucks are the dream of a better future that we all share.  Currently Game Knight is the club to actively endorse Brandeis Fun Bucks (with some support from the Turtles in Time DJs) but we hope to gain support throughout the year.  Furthering the cause of Brandeis Fun Bucks is my primary goal for this semester.  I look forward to representing the Mods and the Brandeis community.
