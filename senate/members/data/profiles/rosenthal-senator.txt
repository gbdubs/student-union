My name is Nathan Schneider and I am from Janesville, Wisconsin. I am majoring in neuroscience with a minor in theater. Outside of the student union, I am in many performing groups such as Proscenium, Top Score, and Wind Ensemble. I decided to run for the student union because I feel there is a disconnect between the union and the people they represent. During my short time in the student union, I hope to bridge this gap. I want people to feel that their wants or concerns are heard and validated. I would like to establish a forum for discussion with the people in my quad and make a difference where it is most important. Office Hours: Thursdays: 1:00-2:00 pm; Fridays: 2:00-4:00 pm.
