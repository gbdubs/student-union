Hi everyone! My name is Hannah Brown and I am the Senator for North Quad for the 2015-2016 school year. I am a first-year who is currently undeclared, but I hope to pursue a double-major in Business and International and Global Studies. I was born and raised in Longview, Texas where I participated actively in school and activities and learned how to take on a leadership role, and now I am excited to be up North. In addition to the Student Union, I am also a member of TAMID, The Odyssey at Brandeis, Krav Maga Club and more; plus, I love participating in community service. I like to stay busy, but, when Iâ€™m not working, I enjoy reading, writing, staying fit, and spending time with friends and family. I joined the Student Union in order to give to the people who have already given so much to me. I love people, I love to be productive and helpful, and I love Brandeis, so I am ready to work for the students here. My goals for the year include expanding Brandeisian pride, improving cleanliness and uptake of facilities, community bonding, and advancing the goals of my constituents; my first initiative will be to obtain community cleaning supplies for the dorms. I pride myself on being approachable, so do not be afraid to talk to me in-person or to contact me through social media or my email, hcbrown@brandeis.edu. I want to be there for you if you need advice, have ideas or critiques, or simply need someone to chat with. I want to hear from you, and I would love to meet you. I aim to make the college experience at Brandeis more comfortable and more enjoyable for the residents of North Quad and for all Brandeisians - I look forward to working for (and with) you!
