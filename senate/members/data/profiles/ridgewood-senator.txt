Mitchell Beers
mbeers@brandeis.edu
My name is Mitchell Beers, I am from a town in Northern New York called Schroon Lake, and I am a member of the Class of 2017. My majors are Health: Science, Society and Policy and Anthropology with a biological concentration. I have three semesters of the Senate under my belt as Midyear senator and East Quad senator, and I look forward to representing Ridgewood Quad this year! Outside of the Student Union I am a Waltham Group Coordinator for Blood Drive, and a two time Orientation Leader. My inspiration for being apart of the Student Union is the enthusiasm and vision of the students here. Being surrounded by their amazing minds, I want to ensure their ideas are heard and acted upon. As a senator, I look forward to being the chairperson of the Campus Operations Working Group, and improving Facilities and DCL through initiatives that will benefit the student body. Office Hours: Saturdays: 11:00 am-1:00pm.
