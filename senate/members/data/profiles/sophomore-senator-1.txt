I am a triple major in Environmental Studies, History, and WGS from Kennebunk, Maine. Outside of the Student Union, I am also involved in Brandeis Climate Justice, club soccer, and Her Campus. My goals are to improve sustainability at Brandeis and bring more attention to environmental issues. To do this and be a good senator to the Class of 2018, I want to increase transparency between the administration and student body through the Student Union. So please contact me with any issues you feel the administration needs to address or that requires more attention at Brandeis and by the Student Union!
