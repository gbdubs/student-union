Hi, I’m Callahan Cox. I’m a sophomore from South Carolina and am interested in studying International and Global Studies. I enjoy college (Go Gamecocks!) and national league football and also enjoy watching a leisurely golf tournament on a Sunday afternoon.  On campus I’m also involved with the fitness club Brandeis Firecrackers and I also recently joined the Mountain Club, and hope to become more involved with them.  I also hope to continue volunteering and donating with the Waltham Blood Drive on campus.  In addition to my club activities and classes, I also work at Facility Services on campus and hope to work with the Campus Operations Working Group committee to help with any on campus problems.  I got involved with Student Union in the hopes of being more aware of what is going on at Brandeis and how these changes will affect me and my fellow students and making these happenings known to others.  During my first semester as East Quad Senator I hope to be able to bring a game table or television remote to the shared lounge. Office Hours: Mondays: 5:00-6:00 pm; Tuesdays: 6:30-7:30 pm; Wednesdays: 5:00-6:00 pm.
