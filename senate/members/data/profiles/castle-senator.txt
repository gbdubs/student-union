Castle Senator

My name is Max Whitmore and I am excited to be the Castle Senator for the 2015-2016 school year. I hail from Wayne, New Jersey and am planning to major in Computer Science. Outside of student union, I run for the Cross Country and Track & Field teams (skew!), grade for math classes, and often find myself perusing the c-store for upwards of 12 hours per day. I got involved in the union because I want to help shape our campus by bridging the gap between the voices of students and faculty/staff. By the end of the first semester, I hope to make alterations to the Brandeis' By-Laws (as part of the Means and Ends Committee) that help campus function smoother, and provide the best resources possible to Castle residents.
