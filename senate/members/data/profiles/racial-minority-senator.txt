Hi I’m Beth, I’m majoring in Biological Physics and minoring Economic. I am currently the Racial Minority Senator in the Student Union. Throughout my Brandeis career, I have been part of BASO (Brandeis African Student Organization), BBSO (Brandeis Black Student Association), and WOCA (Women of Color Alliance). I ran for a student union position to become an even more active advocate for the diverse student body on campus. I founded the facebook page Black Brandeis, to acknowledge and celebrate Black Presence, and #BlackExcellence in the Brandeis community. During my time at the student union, I would like to publish a yearly calendar to highlight important events from the various cultural groups that happen on campus. I would like my position as Racial Minority Senator to bring various cultural groups together through monthly meetings/checkins and through collaborative event planning. Currently, I am involved with planning the Brandeis Diversity Conference that will bring students from many backgrounds together to discuss important topics of race (ethnicity), class, and gender that affect our lived experiences. In addition, I am scheduling joint-events for Black History Month, National Hispanic Heritage Month, Asian-Pacific American Heritage Month this year to acknowledge, and celebrate the triumphs and achievements of many people of color both in and outside Brandeis.
