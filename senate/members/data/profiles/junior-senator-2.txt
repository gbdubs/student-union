Hey everyone, my name is Matt Smetana and I’m a member of the Class of 2017 studying Environmental Studies. Aside from being a Class of 2017 Senator I lead the Brandeis Sustainability Committee and strive to make our campus a more environmentally conscious place. I joined the student union to bridge the divide between students, the Student Union, and the administration. Most importantly, I am a voice for the Class of 2017 and am extremely open to discuss issues relevant to all members of my class or other persons. Over the past semester, the Sustainability Committee sent a proposal for a university-wide environmental literacy requirement to the Undergraduate Curriculum Committee and reviewed the Brandeis Sustainability Fund proposals. Over this semester, the committee will be creating a video series educating the Brandeis community on climate change and environmental degradation. If you want to contact me about any issues or talk about nerdy ecological matters, feel free to reach out!
