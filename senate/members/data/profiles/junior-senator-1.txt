I am a history and anthropology major in the Class of 2017 at Brandeis. On top of my work with the Student Union, I am involved in BFC (the club soccer team), I work in the Office of Students and Enrollment, and I am currently one of the co-coordinators for Senior Week this year. This is my first semester in the union. For my semester in the senate, I am eager to continue serving the community by working to review how the clubs on campus are organized and to find a way to improve our club structure.
