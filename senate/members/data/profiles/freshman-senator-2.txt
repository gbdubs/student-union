My name is Nathan Greess and I am proud to be serving as Class of 2019 Senator on the Student Union Senate! I live and went to school in Massachusetts and on campus, I live in Shapiro Hall in Massell Quad. I am a prospective economics and politics major and I also have an interest in topics of history and women’s studies. Outside of my duties at the Union, I work with NARAL, a non-profit organization focused on women’s health policy, which has a campus chapter as well. I became involved in the Union with the hope and intent of providing strong representation to the Class of 2019 and supporting broader community development. Since being elected, I have attempted to immerse myself in the intricate ins and outs of the Union and University, hoping to identify the best ways to advocate and produce results for students and their ideas. Moreover, I view the Senate and Union as integral to Brandeis’ strong community as the students’ collective voice—what the Union lacks in unfettered power it can make up for in the power to advocate. This year, I intend to focus on making efficient our clubs and club funding as to better support causes about which Brandeis’ students are passionate. More broadly, I hope to foster a culture of communication between the Union and students so ideas, concerns, and questions reach the people who can best address them. I am greatly looking forward to working with my peers in the Union and throughout the community to get to work on the issues that matter to you!
