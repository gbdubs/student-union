Midyear Senator

I am a midyear who's excited to join the Student Union. Because student loans are now the 2nd largest source of crippling debt, my main focus as Midyear Senator is to help out the Financial Accessibility Campaign, to make sure that financial aid is being increased by a proportional amount when the cost of attendance is raised. I'm a current biology major who plans to add economics or business as a minor. I'm also a coach's assistant on Brandeis' Men's Basketball Team. I look forward to working with my peers to make Brandeis the best it can be. Go Judges!
