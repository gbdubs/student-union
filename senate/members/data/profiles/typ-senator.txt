Hello! My name is Gabriela “Gaby” Gonzalez Anavisca and I am the Myra Kraft Transitional Year Program Senator. Currently, I intend to double major in Sociocultural Anthropology and Political Science with double minors in Film and the French language. Outside of academics, I am involved in Cheer club and Comic Book club because I love going out of my comfort zone and trying new things. This passion for trying new things is part of the reason I joined Student Union. I also wanted to be directly involved with change and give a voice to people who believed they were unable to be heard.  There are many things I could promise you, my constituents, but there is only one thing I can guarantee: I will be here for you. I promise to do my best to fight for your voices and fix your concerns.
