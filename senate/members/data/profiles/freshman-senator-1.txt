Hello! My name is Kate Kesselman and I am from New York City. I am the current Class of 2019 Senator and Aboard representative. My aspiring majors include business and theater. Outside of the student union I am involved in an A cappella club and the boxing club. I got involved in the student union because I did student government throughout high school. In student government, I realized how empowering it felt to be a part of an organization that was making changes that helped many people. I hope to help make the union more transparent and continue to support my constituents over the next semester. Office Hours: Fridays: 12:00-3:00 pm.
