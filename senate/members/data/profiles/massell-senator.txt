Hey everyone! I am majoring in International and Global Studies and considering adding a minor business. In addition to serving in the Student Union, I am in the Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity, and I am a sports section writer for The Justice. I hope to become more involved with WBRS, with the idea of having a radio show and broadcasting games for the Judges. I involved myself with the Student Union in order to enact tangible change for my peers and the Brandeis community. Brandeis’ student life flourishes because of the opportunities students are presented with, whether it is through clubs, organizations, residence life, or other means. I hope Student Union is a vehicle to better the overall student experience by helping students’ efforts and providing them with more opportunities.It is through providing opportunities which we see Brandeis’ best qualities—a tight-knit, inclusive community blended with a sense of resound individualism. As Massell Quad Senator, my first priority is representing the residents of Massell Quad and bettering life for all students and community members. I hope to improve Massell Quad by working to develop three-to-five significant improvements to facilities.
