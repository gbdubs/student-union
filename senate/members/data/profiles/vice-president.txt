My name is Dennis Hermida-Gonzalez. I was born and raised in Manat√≠, Puerto Rico. I am a double major in Sociology and Theater Arts with minors in Creativity the Arts and Social Transformation, and Legal Studies. Outside of the Student Union, I am involved in a comedy group called Boris' Kitchen and I am also planned Orientation for the Class of 2019 as a Core Committee member. The reason I got involved with the Student Union is because I think that it is so important for the student body to feel as though they are constantly being heard, and I am so excited to be a voice for you all. One initiative I have is that I want to push transparency between the Student Body and the Senators.
