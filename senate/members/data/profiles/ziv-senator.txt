Hey Brandeis! My name is Gwen Fraser, and I'm a member of the Class of 2017, studying English, Psychology, and Creative Writing. I'm very excited to start advocating for residents of Ziv Quad as the new Ziv Quad Senator. While this position is only a semester long, I hope to use this time to make sure that my constituents feel heard, as well as begin long-term initiatives that will extend beyond my own semester in this role. Please feel free to reach out to me at any time with concerns or questions!
