Off Campus Senator

Hi, I'm Sam!  I chose to run for off campus senator to better integrate off and on campus life, hopefully through the organization of a ridesharing carpool program. I am an HSSP major from Woodbridge, CT, and when I'm not doing my senatorial duties I am a coordinator for the Waltham group Community Connections. If you see me around campus, don't be shy, please introduce yourself and if I have the time, give me a piece of your mind about how we can work together to make our community a better place!
