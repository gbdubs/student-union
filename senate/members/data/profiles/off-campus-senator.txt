Hi, my name is Mitch Mankin. I'm a senior majoring in Economics and International and Global Studies, with a minor in Social Justice and Social Policy. In addition to the Student Union, I'm involved in the Brandeis International Journal, Brandeis Labor Coalition, Brandeis Jazz Ensemble, Brandeis Improv Collective, and Brandeis Academic Debate and Speech Society. I'm currently choosing among several initiatives to pursue this semester. Those initiatives are as follows: 1) Creating a guide that will walk students through the process of finding off-campus housing, including figures on average area rents and typical food expenditures, information on building effective relationships with landlords, and basics of searching for and evaluating homes. This guide would likely require a survey of current off-campus students and would take a significant investment of time. 2) Working with the Brandeis administration to create a petition process similar to that of petitions.whitehouse.gov, which would create a robust framework for democratic dialogue between the students and the administration on the issues closest to our hearts. 3) Restoring full ID card access to on-campus dorms and common spaces for off-campus students, after the Department of Community Living revoked it without notice last semester. I recognize that the obstacles to each of these initiatives may be considerable, and regardless of their progress I will continue to listen to and seek out the opinions of my constituents, in order to better represent their concerns in the Student Union and accomplish the smaller projects that are important to them. Don't hesitate to reach out with any questions, concerns, or ideas to mrocket@brandeis.edu
